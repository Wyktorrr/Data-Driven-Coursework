# Coursework

The main scope of this course work was to implement least squares regression to determine and plot functions (line segments made out of 20 points) and produce the total reconstruction error. The functions could be linear, polynomial with a fixed order that I had to determine, or unknown nonlinear that was again up to me to determine (I considered functions such as cos and sin). Each data set could be made out of numerous functions.
